This repository contains implementation of a high-accuracy and efficient Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for predicting Collision Cross-Section (CCS) values in ion mobility spectrometry.

##  About The Project

Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) is a powerful analytical technique for separating ions based on their size and shape. A key parameter in IMS is the **Collision Cross-Section (CCS)**. Accurate prediction of CCS values from molecular structures is crucial for identifying small molecules in complex mixtures, especially in non-target screening.

This project introduces a robust GNN model that predicts CCS values for both positive and negative ions based solely on their SMILES representation. Our approach utilizes an innovative weighting scheme based on **Tanimoto similarity**, which improves the model's accuracy by increasing the importance of structurally unique molecules during training.

###  Key Features

- **State-of-the-Art Accuracy:** Achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of **3.39 Å²** on the benchmark test set from Xie et al. (2024), demonstrating superior performance.
- **Graph Neural Network (GNN):** Represents molecules as graphs to effectively capture topological and chemical features, leading to more accurate predictions.
- **Tanimoto Similarity Weighting:** Employs a sample weighting mechanism where the weight is calculated as `1 - Sa` (Sa being the average Tanimoto similarity to the `Ns=25` nearest neighbors). This improves generalization for underrepresented molecules.
- **Efficient Architecture:** Provides a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency compared to deeper models.
- **Reproducible & Configurable:** The entire pipeline is managed via a `config.yaml` file, and results can be tracked using TensorBoard.

##  Results

The model was trained on a combined dataset from "METLIN-CCS" and Xie et al. and evaluated on two independent test sets.

### Performance Metrics

The table below shows the comprehensive performance of our model on the two test sets.

| Test Set                  | MAE (Å²) | RMSE (Å²) | MAPE (%) | MDAE (Å²) |
| :------------------------ | :------: | :-------: | :------: | :-------: |
| **Test Set 1 (Xie et al.)** | **3.3930** |  4.7216   |  1.8922  |  2.4693   |
| **Test Set 2 (External)** | 7.3720  |  9.2532  |  2.8930  |  6.4836   |

### Comparison with State-of-the-Art

Our model shows a significant improvement in MAE compared to the previous state-of-the-art model by **Xie T. et al. (2024)** on the same test sets.

| Model                                | Test Set 1 MAE (Å²) | Test Set 2 MAE (Å²) |
| :----------------------------------- | :-----------------: | :-----------------: |
| **Our Model (GNN + Tanimoto Weights)** |    **3.39**         |    **7.37**        |
| Xie T. et al. (2024)                 |      *3.78*       |      *9.1*       |

##  Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Metlin_CCS.git
    cd Metlin_CCS
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

##  Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

The raw data files (`.csv`) are not included in this repository due to their size. You can download the required dataset archive from the following link:

**[>> Download Dataset (Metlin_CCS_Data.zip) <<](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15gv2jS6eH-BfBCEpYVhYxKiJdO1gwcS9?usp=sharing)**

After downloading, unzip the archive. Place all `.csv` files inside the `data/raw/` directory. The final structure should look like this:
- `Metlin_CCS/`
  - `data/`
    - `raw/`
      - `data_main_stand.csv`
      - `data_external_stand.csv`
      - `external_test_set1_stand.csv`
      - `external_test_set2_stand.csv`
      - `tanimoto_spec.csv`

The project is now ready for training. No further preprocessing is needed as the scripts handle it automatically.

### 2. (Optional) Generating Tanimoto Weights

The `tanimoto_spec.csv` file, used for sample weighting, is provided in the dataset archive. However, you can regenerate it using the following script. This is useful if you use a different dataset or change the number of nearest neighbors (`Ns`).

For our experiments, we used `Ns=25`.
```bash
python src/generate_tanimoto.py --main_data_path data/raw/data_main_stand.csv --external_data_path data/raw/data_external_stand.csv --a 25
```

### 3. Training a New Model

All training parameters are controlled via `config.yaml`. To start training, run:
```bash
python src/train.py --config config.yaml
```
Training logs will be saved in the `runs/` directory, and the best model will be saved in `models/`. You can monitor the training process using TensorBoard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir runs
```

### 4. Evaluating the Trained Model

To evaluate the best model from a training run on the test sets, use the `evaluate.py` script. You need to provide the path to the specific experiment directory.
```bash
# Replace with the actual path to your experiment results
python src/evaluate.py --experiment_dir models/lr0.0001_bs32_with_tanimoto
```

### 5. Predicting for a Single Molecule

Use the `predict.py` script to get a CCS prediction for a new molecule.
```bash
# Replace with the actual path to your best model
python src/predict.py --model_path models/lr0.0001_bs32_with_tanimoto/best_model.pt --smiles "CCO" --adduct "[M+H]+"
```
